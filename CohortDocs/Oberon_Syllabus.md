Students are encouraged to do their own research and utilize external resources as
well.

## Grades

Your grade is made of the following components:

| Item                | Percentage | Description                                                     |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quizzes             |        20% | Cumulative average of every multiple choice quiz                |
| Exercise Completion |        20% | Cumulative percentage of curriculum exercises completed         |
| Assessments         |        40% | Average performance on assessments (timed coding challenges)    |
| Attendance          |        20% | Attendance percentage                                           |

- Academic Progress is measured in 5 periods of 4 weeks. 
    - Reports will be delivered within a week of period completion
- Multiple-choice quizzes will be taken at the end of every module
- Exercise completion will be determined based on the work on your GitHub account
    - No credit will be given for misnamed files, branches, or repositories
    - No credit will be given for files that are not in the correct location
    - Only files on the master branch will be graded (unless otherwise noted)

## Classroom Conduct

Please be respectful and professional in your interactions with Codeup staff, your peers and potential employers.

**Do**

- Ask questions
  - Vocally, in Zoom chat, or Slack -> All are welcome!
- Collaborate with and help your peers
  - Sometimes we learn best from each other!
- Be curious and seek out new challenges
  - Finished with your work and want more. Ask!
  - Want to pick up that online project? Do it!
- Silence your cellphone
  - Don't be the reason someone is distracted from a lesson and misses something important.
- Take breaks when you need them
  - Self-care is self-love 

**Avoid**

- Engage in off-task activities during class time (YouTube, Netflix, news
  sites, gameing, social media, etc.)
- Call and text on your cellphone
- Discourage others
- Sleep during class hours

We ask that you leave the classroom to perform non-classroom related activities.

### Attendance

Class starts at 9:00 every morning. This doesn't mean you should show up at 9,
rather, you should be ready to begin at 9, meaning you should be present at
least 10 to 15 minutes prior in order to review the past day's material and
prepare for the current day.

- Arriving later than 9:00 counts as a tardy
- Arriving later than 9:15 counts as a half day absence
- Leaving before 4:45 counts as a half day absence
- Leaving before 5 counts as an early departure

Please do come to class early if you want to hang out, ask questions, 
or listen to our questionable taste in music.

If you are not going to be present for any reason, email [oberon-staff@codeup.com](oberon-staff@codeup.com)
to let us know.

#### Classroom Hours:

- Generally 9 to 5
- End early on Tuesdays (4pm)
- Long lunch or lunchtime speakers on Thursdays

|     | Start | Lunch        | Stop |
|-----|-------|------------  |------|
| Mon | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 5:00 |
| Tue | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 4:00 |
| Wed | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 5:00 |
| Thu | 9:00  | 12:00 - 1:30 | 5:00 |
| Fri | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 5:00 |

In addition, we will often hold "Office Hours" after class to provide additional assistance or just decompress!

## How to Get Help

The primary way to get your questions answered is by asking them in the
classroom during classroom hours both during lecture and exercise time.
Instructors and student fellows will be available to help you.

Outside of classroom hours, email [oberon-staff@codeup.com](oberon-staff@codeup.com) or send a Slack message to the #oberon-questions channel for help with your
questions. 

When emailing for support, please be sure to include all instructors
in the email through the [oberon-staff@codeup.com](oberon-staff@codeup.com) list, as opposed to emailing an
individual instructor.

In addition, you may schedule time with a TA or
instructor during study hall hours (before or after class).

## Miscellaneous

### Teamwork / Collaboration

Development is not a solo activity. You will be expected to work collaboratively
with your classmates, both informally throughout the course, and formally, in
the form of pair and group projects.

Please be kind and patient to each other (and yourself). 

Remember: learning something new is challenging for everyone. The way you communicate with to your teammates can be what makes this a fun and succesful experience!

### Presentations / Code Demos

Throughout the course you might be called upon to demo and discuss your work to
the rest of the class. 

- This is an opportunity to hone your skills of explain both the use of your applications and eloquently describe how your code accomplishes those uses!
- You may feel anxious before presenting but don't worry. We are here to support and lift each other!
- When someone else is presenting, be an active listener. You want the same respect when you are presenting as well.
- If someone else has a cool design or clever code solution, let them know! It feels good to know your work is noticed and appreciated.
