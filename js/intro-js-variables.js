// =========== VARIABLES ===========

// Know about the purpose of variables in math?

// Yeah, it's the same idea here!

// A variable is a symbolic representative of a value that can be different in each run of a function

// What good is data if we don't have a way to pass around and use it in various ways?

// Introducing: variables!.... again!

// you have (in this order, left to right):
// the type of variable,
// the name of the variable,
// the assignment operator (=),
// and the value (in this case, a number)
//var num = 5; // now we have a variable we can use in other places!

// By declaring a variable, we are commanding the runtime (our language's engine for actually running the program)
// to reserve a bit of memory (RAM) for the value stored in said variable.'

// Well, how can we use it?
// Let's call a function (yes, still think in the math sense) which will use it to do something

// In this case, print it out to the user's console:
//console.log(num);

// Deep Dive: (yeah, wikipedia. It's different for computer science)

// ******* Mini Exercise #1 ********

// TODO: !IMPORTANT! - Be sure to comment out code and logs which you are not actively using. Helps keep a clean console!

// TODO: Using the above, log to the console (hint, hint) various numbers, strings, and booleans
//  --> At least 3 of each

// TODO: What happens when you log to the console a variable which has no value? (var num;)

// TODO: ***HINT*** If your console gets crowded with outputs, just press cmd+l (ctrl+l) to clear it
